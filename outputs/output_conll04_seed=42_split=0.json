Booth Gardner is the vice chairman and will follow Branstad as chairman in a year. Both Branstad and Gardner are politicians representing their respective parties and states. It can be inferred that they live and work in their respective states, Iowa and Washington. In a year, when Branstad's term as chairman ends, Gardner will take over, potentially leading to a rivalry or competition between the two."
